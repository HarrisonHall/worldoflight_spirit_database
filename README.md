# World of Light Spirit Databasing
I wanted to practice some databasing skills, so I created a short script to pull
spirit data from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on Fandom into a csv file. At the 
time I figured that fandom would all of the data necessary for the spirits, but 
it appears to be an ongoing effort. Running `parse.py` will remake `spirits.csv` 
with the newest data online.

## Basic Parsing
The csv has the format `Spirit, Artwork Origin, Rating,Type, Support Slots, Ability`.
